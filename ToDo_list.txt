Myprofile: 	Pet info is not initialized
		(Options may have more than one pets, needs "add one" button)
		(image needs "add one" button for choose)
		
		Favorite part is not implemented and static. This part should  		be initialized and not changed. But you can edit description 		for each favorite block.
		
		Message part: To be discussed

		Location: It is static now, everything is not clickeable. 

		
		Take Pet info part apart from my favorite part
			That is adopter will have favorite part.
			Sender will have pet info part		


Display: 	We only display pet info that is only supporting adopter-to-		sender
	
		We need to add more filters like location, type(dog, cat), 		more type(Teddy), gender, or something.
		
		When the pet block is clicked, the user can be directed to 		the owner's profile page and can leave message there. 

		Need to add a favorite symbol to help to favorite the pet
